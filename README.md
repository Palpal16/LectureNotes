### Lecture-Notes
I have been taking notes in $\LaTeX$ for the past few years. Here you can find the main courses of mathematical engineer for the third and fourth years. (More are coming)

# Partial Differential Equations
This course is challenging. For this reason I have put a lot of work into the notes. I am sure you'll find them very usefull!

# Real and Functional anlysis
Same as PDE course.

# Meccanica Razionale
In here you can find all theory for the course. For simplicity I have excluded proofs and examples.  
Source code is available if you want to improve the notes.

# Analisi III
This notes were done more quickly. Only definitions and theorems are present. (Source code available)

# Statistica inferenziale
The first half is complete, in the second part I stopped writing all the redundant examples. (Source code available)

# Analisi Numerica
Course of numerical methods for partial differential equations. This pdf was written to be used for exam memorization, I have summarised the lectures with what I tought was more important.
